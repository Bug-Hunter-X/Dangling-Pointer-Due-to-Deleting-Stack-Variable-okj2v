This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: attempting to delete a pointer to a stack-allocated variable. The code in `bug.cpp` demonstrates the error. The corrected code is in `bugSolution.cpp`, which avoids this problem by allocating the variable dynamically using `new` and deleting it with `delete`.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management in C++ and using `new` and `delete` appropriately.
